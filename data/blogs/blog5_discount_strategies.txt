Title: Discount Strategies for Summer Sales

Body:
Discounts are the heart of summer sales, but how you present them matters. Clear, bold discount messaging grabs attention and drives purchases. Highlight the savings upfront to attract deal-seekers.

Example Ad Copy:
- “Slash Prices This Summer! 50% Off Everything!”
- “Big Savings, Bigger Fun – Shop Summer Deals Now!”

Tips:
1. Use percentage discounts (e.g., “50% Off”) for impact.
2. Bundle offers to increase perceived value.

Test discount-focused copy across channels to optimize conversions.
