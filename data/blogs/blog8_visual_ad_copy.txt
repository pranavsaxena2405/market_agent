Body:
Summer sale ad copy shines when paired with vibrant visuals. Use images of beaches, sunsets, or happy customers to enhance your message and create a cohesive campaign.

Example Ad Copy:

Tips:
1. Match copy tone to visual mood (e.g., upbeat copy with bright images).
2. Use high-quality images to build trust.

Test different visual-copy combinations to find the best performers.
