Title: How to Create Effective Instagram Ads – Marketing Examples

Instagram ads work best when they blend into the feed. Here’s what makes them work:

1. Use authentic, real-life visuals—not polished stock photos.
2. Hook users in the first 3 seconds with bold text or movement.
3. Include captions that provoke curiosity or emotion.
4. CTA examples: “Swipe to see more,” “Claim your deal,” or “Try it now.”

Ads with a native, organic feel outperform polished brand-style posts.
