Title: Urgency-Driven Summer Sale Ad Copy

Body:
Urgency drives action. In summer sales, ad copy that creates a sense of scarcity or time pressure can skyrocket conversions. Phrases like “Hurry!” or “Last Chance!” push customers to act fast.

Example Ad Copy:
- “Hurry! Summer Sale Ends Midnight – Save 40% Now!”
- “Last Chance for Summer Deals – Shop Before They’re Gone!”

Tips:
1. Use countdown timers in ads to visualize urgency.
2. Highlight limited stock to increase FOMO.

Test urgency-driven copy on landing pages and emails to see what resonates.
